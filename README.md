This fork has a goal purpose of restructuring Genes and Gene Inheritance. Removal of sphaghettified .XML lines of code and seperation of patches outside of main code for a clean build and universal support and syntax between Race Support and RJW Core.

## Current Features 

-

## Compatibility Patches 

-

## Structure

- Toplevel: By Function (i.E. "Genes", "Animal Inheritance", "Utility")
- Then: By Domain, following the Gene-Categories ("Cosmetic","Special", "Damage",...)
- Last: By Type of Action (Def, Patch, etc.)

So if you want to change / add a gene about shrinking cocks you were to go: `Genes -> GenitaliaSize -> Defs`.
